  {
    question:
      "3. What is the difference between the MERN Stack and the MEAN Stack? Which is better?",
    answer:
      "The primary difference between the MERN and MEAN stacks lies in the front-end framework each uses: MERN uses React while MEAN uses Angular. MERN is often preferred for its flexibility, allowing developers to create dynamic, single-page applications with a high level of customization due to React’s component-based structure. On the other hand, MEAN offers a more structured framework with Angular, making it ideal for larger applications that benefit from Angular’s built-in features like two-way data binding. Which stack is 'better' depends on the project requirements: MERN is popular for simpler, highly interactive applications, while MEAN is suited for complex, large-scale applications that need a stable structure. Both stacks, however, offer robust solutions for full-stack development.",
