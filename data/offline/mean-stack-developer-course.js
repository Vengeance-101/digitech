    question: "1.What is the MEAN Stack, and why is it beneficial to learn? ",
    answer:
      "MEAN Stack is a popular technology stack comprising MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js, ideal for building robust, dynamic web applications. Learning it enables full-stack development using JavaScript, making it efficient and highly in demand among employers.",
  },
  {
    question:
      " 2.Who can enroll in the MEAN Stack development course at Digitechmate?",
    answer:
      "This course is designed for beginners, web developers, or anyone looking to transition into full-stack development. Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge is recommended but not mandatory.",
  },

  {
    question:
      "3. What is the difference between the MERN Stack and the MEAN Stack? Which is better?",
    answer:
      "The primary difference between the MERN and MEAN stacks lies in the front-end framework each uses: MERN uses React while MEAN uses Angular. MERN is often preferred for its flexibility, allowing developers to create dynamic, single-page applications with a high level of customization due to React’s component-based structure. On the other hand, MEAN offers a more structured framework with Angular, making it ideal for larger applications that benefit from Angular’s built-in features like two-way data binding. Which stack is 'better' depends on the project requirements: MERN is popular for simpler, highly interactive applications, while MEAN is suited for complex, large-scale applications that need a stable structure. Both stacks, however, offer robust solutions for full-stack development.",
  },

  {
    question:
      "4. What makes the MEAN Stack different from other development stacks?",
    answer:
      "MEAN Stack uses JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, which simplifies the development process, enhances code reusability, and ensures seamless integration across all components.",
