    question: "1. What is the difference between UI and UX?",
    answer:
      "UI stands for User Interface and UX stands for User Experience. UI focuses on the look, color, and feel of a product, while UX focuses on how a product works and how users interact with it. UI is concerned with the visual elements of a product, such as the layout, typography, colors, and images, while UX is concerned with the overall experience of using the product, including the usability, accessibility, and pleasure derived from using it.",

      "3. What is the difference between a UI UX Designer and a graphic designer? Which is better?",

      "UI/UX designers focus on user experience and interaction, creating intuitive and functional interfaces. Graphic designers focus on visual communication, creating aesthetically pleasing designs for print and digital media. Choosing between them depends on your interests; neither is inherently better, as both play vital roles in design.",
